# Project Title: Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Short Description
This project develops a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various features such as engine specifications, fuel type, transmission, and mileage. The dataset is preprocessed, analyzed, and used to train regression models that estimate car prices based on input features.

## Key Components Involved
### Programming Language
- Python

### Libraries Used
- **pandas** – for data loading and preprocessing
- **numpy** – for numerical computations
- **scikit-learn** – for building machine learning models

## Data Processing Steps
- Loading the car dataset (`car_dataset.csv`)
- Checking dataset shape and structure (`df.shape`, `df.head()`)
- Handling missing values and duplicates
- Feature selection and data transformation

## Machine Learning Implementation
- **Train-Test Split**: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
- **Model Selection**: Testing different regression models
- **Performance Evaluation**: Using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score
